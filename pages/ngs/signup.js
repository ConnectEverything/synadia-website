            We appreciate you signing up for NGS. In a few short steps we'll
            have you up and running and sending messages.
          </h3>

          <h3 className="inner">Installation of the NGS utility</h3>

          <p>
            The first thing you'll need to do is install the NGS{' '}
            <span className="highlight">CLI</span> (Command Line Interface). The{' '}
            <span className="highlight">ngs</span> utility is used to signup and
            administer your NGS account.
          </p>

          <p>
            The installation process is straightforward. Open up a command
            prompt and type the following:
          </p>

          <CopyCode content="$ curl https://downloads.synadia.com/ngs/install.py -sSf | python" />

          <p>
            This will install the <span className="highlight">ngs</span> utility
            into ~/.ngs/bin. Follow the instructions provided by the ngs utility
            after the download completes to get signed up, and to send your
            first message!
          </p>

          <p>
            You can get usage help anytime by executing{' '}
            <span className="highlight">ngs -h</span>.
          </p>

          <h3 className="inner">The Free Plan</h3>

          <p>
            To sign up for a free account you'll use the{' '}
            <span className="highlight">ngs signup</span> command
          </p>

          <CopyCode content="$ ngs signup --free" />

          <h3 className="inner">Paid plans</h3>

          <p>
            Signing up for paid plans is similar to signing up for the free plan
            except with a few more steps. In addition to finding plan
            information on{' '}
            <a href="https://synadia.com/ngs/pricing">
              synadia.com/ngs/pricing
            </a>
            , you can view information about current plans locally with the
            following command:
          </p>

          <CopyCode content="$ ngs account plans" />

          <p>
            You'll see the list of available plans, select the one that most
            closely matches your requirements. If your needs exceed any of the
            plans listed, contact us at{' '}
            <a href="mailto:info@synadia.com">info@synadia.com</a> and weâ€™d be
            happy to help create a custom plan for you.
          </p>

          <CopyCode content="$ ngs signup" />

          <p>
            Check your email, within a minute or so you will receive an email
            with a link to a secure payment page. There you can enter your
            payment information and activate your account. Follow the
            instructions to complete the signup process with{' '}
            <span className="highlight">ngs signup</span>. If you leave ngs
            signup running, it will auto-complete. Otherwise you can check your
            account status with:
          </p>

          <CopyCode content="$ ngs account status" />

          <p>
            Information about your NGS account status will be displayed. We bill
            on a monthly basis, so you will see a four week expiry, which will
            be renewed on the next automatic credit card payment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The signup process will generate the necessary credentials to
            activate your account. To test that everything is working, let's
            send our first message.
          </p>

          <CopyCode content="$ ngs demo echo <some text>" />

          <p>
            If successful, you will see something like the following:
            <code>
              > ngs demo echo HELLO <br/>Published [ngs.echo] : 'HELLO'<br/>Received
              [_INBOX.IUAKVmH8SZfgJc6M666obM.wn1hGbsk] : '[California, US]:
              "HELLO"'
            </code>
          </p>

          <p>
            After the project has been created, be sure to{' '}
            <span className="highlight">securely backup the private nkeys</span>{' '}
            generated by the signup process.
          </p>
